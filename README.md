# Unsupervised Learning and PCA Analysis Repository

## Overview

This repository documents the exploration and analysis of an unlabeled dataset, specifically the iris dataset without labels, in two distinct phases. In the first phase, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied from scratch, with a focus on optimizing the Q Matrix for dimensionality reduction. In the second phase, the Entropy-Based Fuzzy Clustering algorithm is implemented as an unsupervised learning technique, both before and after applying PCA, with a careful evaluation of the impact.

## Phase 1: PCA Implementation

- **Dataset Selection:**
  - An unlabeled dataset is chosen for exploration, with the iris dataset used without labels.

- **PCA Technique Implementation:**
  - PCA is applied from scratch, emphasizing dimensionality reduction while preserving the original feature vectors.

- **Q Matrix Variation:**
  - Different Q Matrices are experimented with, and the best one is selected based on the criterion of minimizing changes to the original feature vectors while effectively reducing dimensionality.

- **Report and Comments:**
  - A comprehensive report is provided, detailing the trials, the selected Q Matrix, and insightful commentary on the results obtained from applying PCA.

## Phase 2: Unsupervised Learning with PCA

- **Unsupervised Learning Technique:**
  - The chosen unsupervised learning technique for this phase is the Entropy-Based Fuzzy Clustering algorithm.

- **Application Before and After PCA:**
  - The unsupervised learning technique is applied both before and after the application of PCA with the optimized Q Matrix.

- **Updated Report:**
  - The initial report is updated to include observations and comments on the effects of using PCA in conjunction with the selected unsupervised learning technique.
